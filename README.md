<h1>This is my scrapping scripts</h1>

<h2>The first program is called "Townhall"</h2>
<p>It scraps the e-mail adresses from all the townhall in Val d'Oise</p>

<h2>The second program is called <strong>crypto_price.rb</strong></h2
>
<p>this program is very simple.</p><br>
<p>It creates a hash with the cryptocurrency name as a key and its price as a value</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to the gem <strong>Whenever</strong>, it runs every hours</p>
