<h1>This is my scrapping scripts</h1>

<h2>The first program is called "Townhall"</h2>
<p>It scraps the e-mail adresses from all the townhall in Val d'Oise</p>

<h2>The second program is called <strong>crypto_price.rb</strong></h2
>
<p>this program is very simple.</p><br>
<p>It creates a hash with the cryptocurrency name as a key and its price as a value</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to the gem <strong>Whenever</strong>, it runs every hours</p>

<h2>The third program is called <strong>incubateur.rb</strong>  </h2>

<p>It scraps the name and the ZIP code of the French incubators on this website http://mon-incubateur.com</p>
<p>It has a loop to go through the whole 24 pages.</p>
<p>For the moment it just gets the name, no zipcode so far.</p>
<p>Please, use watir gem to run this script:</p>
<p>Type gem install watir in your terminal as well as gecko driver and move it in your /usr/local/bin folder.</p>
